        Korean cuisine has gone through continuous evolution through social and political change. Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables and meats. Traditional meals tend to have a variety of side dishes that accompany short-grain rides. One popular side dish is seaweed soup, which is one of the recipes the page will be showing you. 

        The other dish that will be introduced is corn bread. While this food is commonly not used to represent Korean cuisine, it was a staple food in the old times. The dish has strong historical meaning, making it worthy dish to put in this page. Corn bread is also very easy to make, so for lazy folks out there, this is the snack for you!

    <h2> Seaweed Soup </h2>

    <h4> What is Seaweed Soup? </h4>

        <p id=soup_description>
          Traditionally, seaweed soup is eaten on birthdays or after giving birth. But these days, seaweed soup is eaten all year around. Seaweed is rich in calcium and iodine which is greater for lowering cholesterol level. Seaweed soup can be eaten on its own but many Korean restaurants serve it as a side dish. Some also like to put mussels and beef brisket inside the soup. This recipe will have beef brisket but can be easily taken out for those who are vegetarian!

    <h4> What is Corn Bread? </h4>

        <p id=bread_description>
          Korean corn bread was a very popular snack long time ago. As a millennial, I was first introduced to this snack by my grandmother who used to eat this every-day at school. This fluffy snack embodies an intense corn flavor but is not too sweet. For a sweet-tooth like me, this is my all-time favorite recipe!
        </p>


        <p id=bread_receipe>
          <h5> Ingredients </h5>
           <ul><li>2 cups of cornmeal
            <li>2 tablespoons of sugar
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt
            <li>1 parge egg
            <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
            <li>1.5 cups of milk
            <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened at room temperature
          </ul>

          <h5> Steps </h5>
          <ol><li>Combine the cornmeal, sugar, salt, egg, vegetable oil and milk in a bowl and mix well. Let it sit for 20 minutes.
          <li>Pre-heat the oven 200 degrees.
          <li>Add baking powder to the batter and mix well. Brush the butter around the sides and bottom of a baking pan (8-inch by 8-inch square)
          <li>Bake for 30 minutes and use a toothpick to check that bread is cooked. The toothpick should come out clean when inserted in the centre of the bread. 
          <li>Remove from oven and turn pan upside down and let the bread cool for a few minutes. 
          </ol>
